h2. What it does

Builds a standalone Firefox extension from Greasemonkey user scripts, with a user interface that lets you turn any script on or off. Supports multiple tabs and exclusive (ie, radio buttons) user styles as well.  GMSC built the "Better Gmail 2":http://ginatrapani.org/workshop/firefox/bettergmail2 Firefox extension among "others":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/60582.
